## üßê Overview
PrivacyBot is a state-of-the-art system designed to explore and evaluate different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It uses LlamaIndex as its core framework to optimize interactions between large language models (LLMs) and data. The project focuses on enhancing user privacy literacy through conversational AI. This repository includes the implementation of various RAG pipelines, from a basic Naive RAG model to more advanced techniques like Sentence Window Retrieval, Auto-Merging Retrieval, Re-ranking, and Prompt Engineering.


## üí° Features
* **Naive RAG Implementation** : A baseline model that combines retrieval and generation.
* **Advanced RAG Techniques** : Includes Sentence Window Retrieval, Auto-Merging Retrieval, Re-ranking, and Prompt Engineering.
* **TruLens Evaluation** : Integration with TruLens framework for detailed evaluation metrics.
* **Configurable Pipelines** : Easily switch between different RAG pipelines.
